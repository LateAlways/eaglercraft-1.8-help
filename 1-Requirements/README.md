# Requirements

So you have decided to try and make a client for eaglercraft 1.8 and here you are. For this tutorial you will need:
- A decent enough computer running 64-bit Windows, MacOS or linux (I will not help anyone using chromeOS, I know most people have chromebooks but I simply will not support it)
- Java version 11 and up
- Something to edit files (Notepad should work too)
- A ZIP archive manager (WinRAR, 7-zip)

## How to install java
### On windows
1. Navigate to [https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?version=11](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?version=11)
You should arrive to a webpage that looks like this.

5. We will download the .msi file since it does all the installation process for us.

6. Wait for the download to finish. It should take a while since it's a big file.
